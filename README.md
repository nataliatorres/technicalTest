The first thing I would take into account is the possibility that the software is buggy/and or the computer is not on its optimal conditions.
Then I would report any bug that I found to the person responsible for the code.

Important info: I was an intern at CIAT for 6 months. I developed two Android Apps that are being used for the germplasm (bean seeds) reception and processing.
